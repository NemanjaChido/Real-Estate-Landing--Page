## Overview

    A Real-Estate hero page built with tailwindcss and React. Leveraging core concepts like components, props, and the useState hook. The Carousel displays different homes/listing, their unique infomations like price,location e.t.c and also toggle buttons. The buttons leverages the useState hook to dynamically render/display each listing when they're clicked by using their index position in the array. The UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes in odere to achieve a maintainable, and interactive design.


### The task
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle menu-icon to view the navigation link on smaller screen sizes
- toggle the arrow-buttons to view next or previous listings

### Continued development

Enjoying working with react and getting used to concepts like Component, props and react hooks like useState. Plus I feel integrating tailwindcss library helps with responsiveness. Finally as always, I'm excited to explore React even more. Lastly, i always look forward to suggestions on how to write better, efficient and maintainable code.
